# Objective
Hive is a **data warehouse software** that enables us to query and manipulate data using an **SQL-like language**. Once we have the data into HDFS, it becomes available for processing. We can perform DDL and DML operations in Hive like we do in SQL. In this exercise, we'll perform different hive operations on hive tables.

# Dataset:
Here, we will have a movies_rating data set. Each user has rated movies, and there are a total of five attributes in the data set: 
- **User_id:** The unique id of a particular user
- **Age:** The age of a user who has rated a movie
- **Gender:** The gender of a user
- **Profession:** The users’ profession, i.e., whether they are doctors, artists, engineers, etc.
- **Ratings:** The total rating given by a particular user to various movies

Each field in the data set is separated by a **'|'** from the other, and each line is separated by **'\n'**.

# Download Dataset:
Below are the steps:

1. Launch AWS EC2 instance and switch to the root user using the command **sudo -i**.
2. Create a directory called **hive_operations** and make it as current directory. Below are commands:
   
   ````
   mkdir hive_operations
   cd hive_operations
   ````

4.	Let’s look at the top few lines of file using below command:
    
    ````
    cat u.user
    ````
