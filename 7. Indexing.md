# Indexing

As we know that Hive deals with Big Data. So, when we write a query, it takes time for the execution due to the large volume of the data. We can optimise the queries in several ways and Indexing is one of them.

Suppose there is a table with the attributes **'id'**, **'Name'** and **'City'**, where 'Name' is the name of a person and the 'City' represents the city where that particular person is residing. Now let's say you want to search the name **'N'** along with their id and city. When you write a query to search the name 'N', it searches row by row. This becomes a time-consuming exercise when you are dealing with Big Data.

To make the querying faster, let's add indexing on the **'Name'** column.

As we can see in the image above, the indexing has been done on the 'Name' column. Each name has been added in the sorted order in the separate data structure, and there is a reference corresponding to each name, representing the rows in the original table.

So, when we search a particular name, it goes to the separate data structure, applies the **Binary Search Algorithm'**, returns the address of the row in the original table and delivers the results.

Hive has 2 types of Indexing: 
- Compact indexing
- Bitmap indexing

## Instances where we can use Indexing:
- When the data set is large in size
- If a faster query execution is required
- Columns that are used more frequently
- For read-heavy applications, where you need to read the data more frequently

## Implementation of Indexing

We need to use below 2 parameters in our queries:

- **COMPACT or BITMAP Keyword:** We can specify the type of indexing that we are going to use for a particular column; either it is COMPACT or BITMAP.
- **Deferred Rebuild:** This is used to defer the process of indexing for the future stage, which means indexing is not active currently. If we want to activate indexing, we need to write the following query separately: **_alter index i1 on user_info rebuild;_** 

#### Creating Index on "profession" columns:

1. Let's execute below queries to create an index **"i1"** on a "profession" column:

   ````
    create index i1 on table user_info (profession) as 'COMPACT' with deferred rebuild;
    alter index i1 on user_info rebuild;
   ````

2. Create another index **"i2"**:

   ````
   create index i2 on table user_info (profession) as 'COMPACT' with deferred rebuild;
   alter index i2 on user_info rebuild;   
   ````

3. Create third index **"i3"** using 'BITMAP' indexing:

   ````
   create index i3 on table user_info (profession) as 'BITMAP' with deferred rebuild;
   alter index i3 on user_info rebuild;
   ````

## Get all indexes on a table:

Use below query to get this details:

  ````
  show formatted index on user_info;
  ````

## Drop index from a table:

Use below queries to delete index created on a table:

  ````
  drop index i1 on user_info;
  drop index i2 on user_info;
  drop index i3 on user_info;
  ````
