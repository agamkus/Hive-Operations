# Indexing

As we know that Hive deals with Big Data. So, when we write a query, it takes time for the execution due to the large volume of the data. We can optimise the queries in several ways and Indexing is one of them.

Suppose there is a table with the attributes **'id'**, **'Name'** and **'City'**, where 'Name' is the name of a person and the 'City' represents the city where that particular person is residing. Now let's say you want to search the name **'N'** along with their id and city. When you write a query to search the name 'N', it searches row by row. This becomes a time-consuming exercise when you are dealing with Big Data.

To make the querying faster, let's add indexing on the **'Name'** column.

As we can see in the image above, the indexing has been done on the 'Name' column. Each name has been added in the sorted order in the separate data structure, and there is a reference corresponding to each name, representing the rows in the original table.

So, when we search a particular name, it goes to the separate data structure, applies the **Binary Search Algorithm'**, returns the address of the row in the original table and delivers the results.

Hive has 2 types of Indexing: 
- Compact indexing
- Bitmap indexing

## Instances where we can use Indexing:
- When the data set is large in size
- If a faster query execution is required
- Columns that are used more frequently
- For read-heavy applications, where you need to read the data more frequently
