# ORDER BY:

The 'ORDER BY' clause:
- Provides the total sorted list of the data.
- Guarantees the total ordering in the output.
- May use multiple mappers but only one reducer.

# SORT BY:
The 'SORT BY' clause:
- Sorts the data at the reducer level only.
- Does not guarantee the total sorting of the data.
- May contain overlapping data in the two reducers.

As we can see, the 'ORDER BY' clause provides the total sorted data, whereas the 'SORT BY' command does not guarantee the overall sorting of the data and may provide overlapping data. Also we learnt, the 'SORT BY' command uses multiple reducers so it works faster than the 'ORDER BY' clause.
