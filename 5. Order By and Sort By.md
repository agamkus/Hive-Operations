# ORDER BY:

The 'ORDER BY' clause:
- Provides the total sorted list of the data.
- Guarantees the total ordering in the output.
- May use multiple mappers but only one reducer.

# SORT BY:
The 'SORT BY' clause:
- Sorts the data at the reducer level only.
- Does not guarantee the total sorting of the data.
- May contain overlapping data in the two reducers.

As we can see, the 'ORDER BY' clause provides the total sorted data, whereas the 'SORT BY' command does not guarantee the overall sorting of the data and may provide overlapping data. Also we learnt, the 'SORT BY' command uses multiple reducers so it works faster than the 'ORDER BY' clause.

## Implementation of ORDER BY:
Let's first run the command to see the top 5 records of the table **"user_info"** and then run the below Order By command to sort the data based on **age**:

````
select id, profession, age from user_info order by age limit 20;
````

After running above query, we received below outcome of sorted data based on **age**:

## Implementation of SORT BY:

Run below commond to get the sorted data based on age. As SORT By clause uses multiple reduces, the final data is sorted based on the records of each reducer.

````
select id, profession, age from user_info sort by age limit 20;
````

Below is the output from the abouve run query:
