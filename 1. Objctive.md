# Objective
Hive is a **data warehouse software** that enables us to query and manipulate data using an **SQL-like language**. Once we have the data into HDFS, it becomes available for processing. We can perform DDL and DML operations in Hive like we do in SQL. In this exercise, we'll perform different hive operations on hive tables.

# Dataset:
Here, we will have a movies_rating data set. Each user has rated movies, and there are a total of five attributes in the data set: 
- **User_id:** The unique id of a particular user
- **Age:** The age of a user who has rated a movie
- **Gender:** The gender of a user
- **Profession:** The usersâ€™ profession, i.e., whether they are doctors, artists, engineers, etc.
- **Ratings:** The total rating given by a particular user to various movies

Each field in the data set is separated by a **'|'** from the other, and each line is separated by **'\n'**.
