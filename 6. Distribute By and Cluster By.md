# CLUSTER BY:
In CLUSTER BY clause:
- Data is distributed into multiple reducers.
- Each reducer containing sorted and non-overlapping data.

Hence, you can conclude that the 'CLUSTER BY' clause is a combination of the 'DISTRIBUTE BY' and 'SORT BY' clauses.

Below is the output which is just distributed data across reducers on the basis of **age**. Also, this data is not sorted and overlapped.:

## Implementation of CLUSTER BY:
Use below query to distribute the data over multiple reducer without overlapping records:

````
select id, profession, age from user_info CLUSTER BY age limit 25;
````
