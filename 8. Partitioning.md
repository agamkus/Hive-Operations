# Partitioning

The partitioning in Hive means dividing the table into some parts based on the values of a particular column like date, course, city or country. The advantage of partitioning is that since the data is stored in slices, the query response time becomes faster.

Partition in Hive is of the 2 types:
- **Static Partitioning:** We need to load the data manually in the partitions.
- **Dynamic Partitioning:** The data gets automatically allocated to the partitions.

## Static Partitioning:
1. Let's create a new table **part_user_info** and partition it on the **profession** column. Below is the query:

    ````
    create table if not exists part_user_info (
      id int,
      age int,
      gender string,
      ratings int )
    partitioned by (profession string)
    row format delimited fields terminated by '|'
    lines terminated by '\n';
    ````

2. This is the way to create the static partitioning. Let's insert the data into the partitioned tables manually Here, we are partitioning the records on the basis of "engineer" profession.

   ````
   insert into table part_user_info partition ( profession= 'engineer')
   select id, gender, age, reviews from user_info where profession='engineer' ;
   ````

3. We can verify the partition created on 'engineer' at the warehouse directory.

   ````
   hadoop fs -ls /user/hive/warehouse/ratings.db/part_user_info;
   ````
   
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56078504/210305902-6c37e06b-24a1-45ba-9dd5-853f030577bb.png)

   As per the above result, we can see that one partition on 'engineer' has been created.
   
4. Now, insert one more record with profession 'doctor'.

   ````
   insert into table part_user_info partition ( profession= 'doctor')
   select id, gender, age, reviews from user_info where profession='doctor' ;
   ````
   
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56078504/210306280-aa40ec4e-bf49-4e40-a4a2-dcb816d03000.png)

5. Let's verify the partion created on 'doctor':

   ````
   hadoop fs -ls /user/hive/warehouse/ratings.db/part_user_info;
   ````
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56078504/210306444-a7c68012-f933-4a35-8341-98548a797896.png)

   
   Now, we can see that there are 2 partitions created.
   

# Dynamic Partitioning

1. By default, the dynamic partitioning is not allowed in Hive. We need to set dynamic partitioning to true:

   ````
   set hive.exec.dynamic.partition = true;
   set hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode = nonstrict;
   ````

2. Let's create a new table **dyn_part_user_info** and partition it on the **profession** column. Below is the query:

   ````
   create table if not exists dyn_part_user_info (
        id int,
        age int,
        gender string,
        ratings int)
    partitioned by (profession string) 
    row format delimited fields  terminated by '|'
    lines terminated by '\n';
   ````
   
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56078504/210309030-e6231bd8-dd4d-4518-b427-864b5025fd93.png)

3. Insert the records into the partitioned table now:

   ````
   insert into table dyn_part_user_info partition (profession)
   select id, age, gender, reviews, profession from user_info;
   ````
   
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56078504/210309222-8deb7435-af53-47c5-a832-3a4614e6a24f.png)
   
4. Now, the values under the **profession** column are automatically allocated into multiple partitions. Let's verify it at the location "user/hive/warehouse/dyn_part_user_info" in HDFS:

   ````
   hadoop fs -ls /user/hive/warehouse/ratings.db/dyn_part_user_info
   ````
   
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56078504/210309907-0bb7db69-4afb-4e20-b4ba-b50997976523.png)
   
   It's clearly shows that hive creates dynamic partitioning for all the available values of a column.
