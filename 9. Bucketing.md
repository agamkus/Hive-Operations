# Bucketing
It is another extremely useful technique to speed up the queries. Bucketing (also called clustering) distributes the data uniformly in various buckets. It is also called clustering.
Though bucketing is similar to partitioning in that it divides the data into smaller, more manageable parts, the difference between partitioning and bucketing is significant. Indeed, it is this difference that decides which one of these to use in which case.

To compare the two techniques, consider the following example: 

- We typically perform partitioning on columns (or groups of columns) such that it produces a manageable number of partitions (directories), such as year, month, state, country etc.
- Suppose we have a column called customer_id and if we partition on it, the number of partitions will be enormous and may actually reduce performance; thus, we can choose to create buckets on customer_id.

It is important to note that bucketing uses the hash of a column to create multiple 'buckets', whereas partitions are more straightforward - they are simply segmented directories according to the value of a column (year, month etc.)

One of the very basic differences between bucketing and partitioning is that when we create partitions, new folders are created for each partition, but in the case of bucketing, multiple files (buckets) are created inside a single folder.

## Creation of Bucketing (Clustering)
1. Bucketing is separate from partitioning. But in general practice, we first create partitions and then buckets. To enable bucketing, we need to enable partitioning also. First run below queries:

   ````
   set hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode=nonstrict;
   set hive.exec.dynamic.partition=true;
   set hive.enforce.bucketing=true;
   ````

2. Let's create a new table **buck_user_info**, partition the table on the column **gender*** and then create 7 buckets on the column **age**. Below are the queries:

   ````
   create table if not exists buck_user_info (
      id int,
      age int,
      profession string,
      ratings int )
   partitioned by (gender string)
   clustered by (age)
   into 7 buckets 
   row format delimited fields terminated by '|' 
   lines terminated by "\n"
   stored as textfile;
   ````

3. Once the table is created,we need to load the data into it. Below is the query to copy the data from the already created "user_info" table to the "buck_user_info" table:

   ````
   insert  into table buck_user_info partition(gender)
   select id,age, profession, reviews, gender from user_info;
   ````
   
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56078504/210714149-a7499b90-1bb3-41e5-8688-94f297ae05e3.png)

4. Now, let's check the directory created on HDFS after running the above queries. First see the partitions based on gender:
   
   ````
   hadoop fs -ls /user/hive/warehouse/ratings.db/buck_user_info
   ````
   
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56078504/210717146-109f4512-1097-4e5d-96a6-05629a39309e.png)
   
   We can see that two partitions, **M** and **F** have been created based on gender.
   
5. Letâ€™s take a look at the buckets for the male and female partitions:

   ````
   hadoop fs -ls /user/hive/warehouse/ratings.db/buck_user_info/gender=F
   hadoop fs -ls /user/hive/warehouse/ratings.db/buck_user_info/gender=M
   ````
   
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56078504/210718000-46ca0c1e-60ea-4eba-a092-1f0a325d3f20.png)
   
   Here, we can see that in the male and female partition folders, total 7 files (buckets) have been created on the basis of "age" column.
